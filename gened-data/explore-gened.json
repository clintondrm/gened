S221 Human Growth and Development in the Social Environment explores influences of the biological, social, cultural, psychological and spiritual dimensions on individual human development and behavior. Students examine how the diverse contexts in which individuals live impact the range of human development and behavior in themselves and others. Understanding human behavior and development from a multidimensional perspective builds a strong foundation for development of skills later in the curriculum. Specifically, foundational concepts presented in this course help students apply critical thinking to an understanding of the diversity of human functioning and implications for the processes of social work assessment, evaluation and intervention. The Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), the accrediting body for School's of Social Work, requires Social Work Programs to demonstrate how each course in the curriculum helps students develop competencies expected of all who seek entry into the profession.

Students acquire knowledge of the prevailing social, political, ideological, and economic contexts that gave rise to the various social welfare policies and programs and have influenced how programs and policies have changed over time. In addition, the students acquire knowledge of manifest and latent functions of social welfare organizations' activities, their relationship to each other. In addition, the interrelationship and sources of conflict between the evolving profession of social work and social welfare services are explored.  In this class students will build critical thinking skills as they consider forces and influences that have lead to the social service delivery system that exist today which will allow them to explore practical methods to influence policy in S 352.
